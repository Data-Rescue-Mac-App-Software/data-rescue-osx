## What is Data Rescue?

**[Data Rescue App for OSX](#)** is a professional-grade data recovery solution that allows users to retrieve lost, deleted, or corrupted files from a wide array of storage devices, including internal hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, SD cards, and external disks. Whether your data was lost due to accidental deletion, disk formatting, system crashes, malware attacks, or hardware failures, **[Data Rescue](#)** provides a secure, reliable, and high-performance workflow to restore your valuable files.

The app offers **[quick scans](#)** to locate recently deleted files and **[deep scans](#)** for more complex recovery scenarios, giving users a high success rate in file restoration. Users can preview recoverable files before initiating recovery, selectively restoring only the files they need. Supported file types include **[documents](#)**, **[photos](#)**, **[videos](#)**, **[emails](#)**, **[archives](#)**, and **[system files](#)**, making it suitable for personal, professional, and enterprise use.

For drives that show early signs of failure, **[disk cloning](#)** and **[imaging tools](#)** allow creating exact copies of the storage device before performing recovery, ensuring the original media is preserved. This is especially useful for failing **[SSD](#)** or hard drives, allowing recovery operations without additional risk. The software also handles fragmented files and partially damaged sectors, intelligently reconstructing data where other tools may fail.

**Advanced features** include customizable scan parameters, sector-level scanning, and the ability to recover files from RAID arrays or partitioned drives. Users can benefit from automatic file sorting, filtering by type or size, and resumeable recovery sessions for large datasets. Optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon processors, **[Data Rescue](#)** ensures efficient scanning and minimal processing time, similar to how [MacX DVD Ripper Pro for MacOS](#) leverages Level-3 [hardware acceleration](#) for faster processing.

**Common scenarios** include:  
- Recovering accidentally deleted files from desktops, documents, or downloads  
- Restoring data after accidental formatting of drives or partitions  
- Salvaging files after system crashes or malware attacks  
- Retrieving content from failing or damaged SSDs and HDDs  
- Reconstructing data from corrupted USB drives or SD cards  

With its intuitive interface, beginners can safely recover data without prior technical knowledge, while advanced users and IT professionals have access to powerful customization tools, detailed logging, and advanced recovery options. Whether you are a home user, creative professional, or IT specialist, **[Data Rescue](#)** provides a reliable, flexible, and high-performance solution for ensuring your data remains safe and recoverable under any circumstances.
